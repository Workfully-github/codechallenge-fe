# Tasks Board
Develop a Board with 4 columns: TODO/DOING/TESTING/DONE

## Considerations:
* Cards can only be moved by one column in any direction.
* There can only be two cards in DOING at any time
* Once in Done, cards cannot go back
* Moving cards to DONE will trigger a confirmation dialog
* All actions on the board must be validated client-side
* Board to be stored in Local Storage

`When in doubt, donâ€™t get blocked. Fill in the gaps and just write down in a Readme file whatever considerations or design decisions you had to make.`

## What we value
* Testing Strategy
* Effective Architectural and design decisions
* Simple design
* GIT atomic commits
* Straightforward setup and execution
